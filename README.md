# Hong Kong's Precipitation IDF curves considering climate change impacts
This repository is created to save gridded precipitation IDF curves in Hong Kong considering future climate change. The IDF curves are generated from a kilometer-scale WRF-based climate simulations under historical and future (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) climates.
